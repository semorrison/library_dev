[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leanprover/library_dev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leanprover/library_dev)

This repository formerly hosted development of the Lean standard library. It is no longer being used, and development has been split between the core library at https://github.com/leanprover/lean and the "Lean mathematical components library" (mathlib) at https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib.
